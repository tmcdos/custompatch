# CustomPatch

Patch a buggy NPM package without forking it.

Based on the handy [diff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) package (there is a `jsdiff` published on the NPM registry but it is a bogus one)

## WHY

This tool does what [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) does (or more accurately - should be doing) but without the related issues:

- it works faster, especially when creating the patch
- it never chokes on its own patches
- it does not break if you try to apply a patch more than once (but shows a warning)
- it does not require/depend on GIT
 
When you have made a bugfix for one of your dependencies but the author/maintainers refuse to accept your PR - you do not need to fork the package.
Create a patch and seamlessly apply it locally for all your builds.

## Installation
```bash
npm install custompatch -g
```

## Setup

It operates in exactly the same way as [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) so you can use the same setup if you have it already.
Add the following to your `package.json`

```json
"scripts": 
{
  "prepare": "custompatch"
}
```

## Usage

### Making patches

Open your IDE and make the required changes for the bugfix inside your dependency in `node_modules`. After that run

```bash
custompatch "name-of-the-buggy-package"
```

This will create a folder called `patches` inside your project and a file called `name-of-the-buggy-package#version.patch` in this folder.
This file will be a unified diff between your fixed version of the dependency and its original code.

You can specify more than 1 package on the command-line - but no command-line options are accepted.

### Updating patches

The process is exactly the same as for creating a patch for the first time.

### Applying patches

Run `custompatch` without arguments inside your project folder - it will apply all the patches from `patches` folder. If you want to target specific patches you can use the --patch (-p) flag like so:

```bash
custompatch --patch "name-of-the-buggy-package"
```

### Reversing patches

To reverse all patches you can use the --reverse (-r) flag like so:

```bash
custompatch --reverse
```

To reverse specific patches you can use the --reverse (-r) flag like so:

```bash
custompatch --reverse "name-of-the-buggy-package"
```

## Benefits of patching over forking

- Forks often require extra build steps - and even more often you do not need this overhead
- CustomPatch warns you when a patch was not applied cleanly - so that you can check that your fix is still valid for the new version of dependency
- Keep your patches colocated with the code that depends on them
- Patches can be reviewed as part of your normal review process, forks probably can't
